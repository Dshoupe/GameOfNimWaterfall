At the start of the first player's turn (chosen randomly), they will take any number from 1 to the max heap count, from any heap, as long as that heap has a number greater than 0. After this the next player's turn is made. This loop continues until there is only one move left to make, which will be to take the final tile from the heap, which makes this player the loser of the round.
